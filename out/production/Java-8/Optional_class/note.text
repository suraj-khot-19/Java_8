1. Java 8 introduced the Optional class in the java.util package to handle situations
where a value may or may not be present.


2.This helps in reducing NullPointerException (NPE) and provides a functional-style
approach to handling optional values.

Key Features of Optional:
- Encapsulation of Null Values: Avoid explicit null checks.
- Functional Programming Style: Use methods like map, flatMap, filter, etc.
- Readable and Safe Code: Makes the code self-explanatory.

optional is like a box we are adding(predicting value will be null/ coming from Db) into it and returning it
