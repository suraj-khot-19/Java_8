A functional interface in Java is an interface that contains exactly one abstract
method. It may have multiple default or static methods, but only one abstract method.
These interfaces are used primarily for lambda expressions and method references.

Hereâ€™s a concise one-liner summary of each point regarding the use of functional interfaces:

1. Lambda Expressions: They enable concise, inline implementation of functional interfaces using lambda expressions.
2. Simplified Code and Readability: Reduces boilerplate code, making your code more readable and compact.
3. Passing Behavior as Arguments: Allows passing behavior (functions) as arguments to methods.
4. Supporting Functional Programming: Facilitates functional programming with higher-order functions and immutability.
5. Event Handling (GUI): Simplifies event handling by using lambda expressions instead of anonymous inner classes.
6. Common Functional Interfaces: Provides predefined interfaces like `Runnable`, `Consumer`, `Supplier`, `Function`, and `Predicate` for common use cases.
